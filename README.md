# Static Comp Challenge 2
The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep building on my HTML/CSS skills. The object is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design.

## Getting Started 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
